keras implementation of  [A simple neural network module for relational reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.01427.pdf)

Relation network is a noval neural network introduced by deepmind in [A simple neural network module for relational reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.01427.pdf). It can achieve super-human performance in challenging visual question answering datasets such as CLEVR.

I implement Relation network using keras and train it on a challenging visual question answering dataset called [Cornell NLVR](https://github.com/cornell-lic/nlvr).
